METADATA: # metadata for default CONSTRUCTION config parameters
  SOURCE:
    - embodied co2 and pen for window frame were looked up in KBOB 2014, assuming wood-aluminium frame
    - Installation characteristic, shading parameters, frame properties were transfered from hard-coded values
      in matlab cesar version.
      Window dividers were removed from the model (as most buildings probably have
      no frame dividers nowadays and adding fixed dividers for all buildings adds thus more inaccuracy and uncertainity
      than it helps to get more accurate results.)
