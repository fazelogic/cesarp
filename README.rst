CESAR-P (Combined Energy Simulation And Retrofitting - Python) calculates the energy demand for a district or other site with
a bottom-up approach by using the building simulation tool EnergyPlus. The steps involved are gathering and calculating 
the parameters per building on your site, generation of the simulation input files (IDF), 
running the simulation with EnergyPlus and post-processing the results. All steps can be run in parallel.

You can also create your customized pipeline to combine simulation of archetypical buildings with a clustering and upscaling
for a large amount of buildings, e.g. whole Switzerland. You would use CESAR-P for the simulation part, but the clustering 
and upscaling are not included in CESAR-P so far.

*Inputs*

As a input, the building **footprint and height, year of construction, building type** (residential, office, ....)
and **hourly weather data** as EnergyPlus weather file (epw) are needed. 
If shading shall be considered **footprints and height of potential neighbours** must be provided.

*Outputs*

Default output is a summary with **annual energy demand** values (heating, cooling, domestic hot water) per building. **Hourly result series** can be queried on demand.
Further CESAR-P is capable of calculating **operational cost and emissions** based on the energy demand results. 
There is also the possibility to apply **retrofit measures** to the building construction and compare between different simulation runs. Output include besides the results 
a detailed Log with the **retrofit measures** along with pricing and embodied emission infromation.

The target audience of the software are energy planners, energy utilities, cities and researchers to identify the time-resolved 
energy consumption of buildings at large scale to successfully in-tegrate renewable energy technologies in buildings and to 
develop energy masterplans for neighborhoods and cities.

Project Info
============

CESAR-P is developed at the **Urban energy systems Laboratory** at Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology).

The whole project is named **CESAR-P**. The repository for the code library is **cesar-p-core**, 
the python base code package name **cesarp** (avoiding the - to be sure not to run into problems in includes etc) 
and the wheel/PyPi package name you use during installation **cesar-p**.

The predecessor tool of CESAR-P is CESAR, for more details see section References.
