# Summary 

Buildings are responsible for a large share of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. With the challenge of
reducing energy consumption and integrating renewable energy sources in buildings and neighbourhoods, an understanding
of energy consumption patterns is needed at different temporal and spatial scales. CESAR-P (Combined Energy Simulation
And Retrofitting - Python) is a bottom-up building stock modelling software to evaluate energy consumption and
retrofitting strategies for individual buildings and neighbourhoods. CESAR-P is used to parameterize models for the
dynamic building energy simulation tool EnergyPlus [@CRAWLEY_ET_AL_2001]. It computes hourly energy demand profiles and
indoor temperatures at the building level and takes into account shading and reflections of surrounding buildings. After
the current energy demand is computed, retrofitting measures for individual buildings can be evaluated in terms of
energy savings, embodied emissions and costs. The default library of CESAR-P is based on Swiss archetypal buildings
created from standards and statistics about the Swiss building stock; however, users can define their custom
constructions and internal conditions for their buildings. CESAR-P is written in Python and is a further development of
the tool CESAR [@WANG_ET_AL_2018]. The building model generator of CESAR-P creates EnergyPlus input data files (.IDF)
for each building within a specified extent, and can process geo-referenced input data as shapefiles (ESRI .shp format)
for geometry. Building usage type and construction information is used to populate the building model. The EnergyPlus
files are executed with a weather file (EnergyPlus epw weather data format) of the geographic location which provides
the necessary climatic context for the building. The results consist of a configurable set of yearly demand values and
hourly resolved times series for each building from EnergyPlus and additional operational costs and emissions. The
retrofit module can be used to modify the parameters of individual building models according to a specified retrofit strategy. Retrofit strategies specify the frequency of retrofits to the main building elements such as walls, windows and roofs across the building stock. The output of the retrofit module includes, in addition to the above-mentioned operational indicators, costs and embodied emissions of retrofitting interventions. All simulation steps can also be run in parallel on multiple cores. The code is platform-independent and is tested to run on Linux and Windows. The source code for CESAR-P has been archived to Zenodo [@cesar-p-zenodo] 

# Statement of need and Key features 

Building energy simulation is used to generate the expected energy demand profiles of buildings. Building energy demand
profiles are useful for planners to evaluate current performance and investigate how buildings will perform under
different scenarios (e.g. building retrofits, changing climate). Building energy simulation is an important tool for decision-making because monitored energy demands are often unavailable. Urban building energy modelling (UBEM) has been established in recent years to support the implementation of energy conservation measures and the integration of renewable energy technologies at the city and district scales. UBEM tools can be classified as taking a top-down or a bottom-up modelling approach. Top-down approaches rely on aggregated data and different drivers (e.g. socio-economic indicators or climate data), whereas bottom-up modelling approaches are based on data at an individual building scale and include either statistical or engineering-based modelling techniques to compute energy demand data of a set of individual buildings [@JOHARI_ET_AL_2020]. Various review papers summarize available tools, including their key features and limitations [@JOHARI_ET_AL_2020]. The CESAR-P software, presented in this paper, falls within the category of bottom-up modelling approaches. CESAR-P uses EnergyPlus as the simulation engine, an open-source building energy simulation software that is widely used in both academia and industry. CESAR-P simplifies the creation of EnergyPlus input files using a set of key parameters which are stored in archetypes. The target audience of the software are energy planners, energy utilities, cities and researchers. The time-resolved energy demand profiles of buildings simulated by CESAR-P are crucial for evaluating renewable energy integration and retrofit strategies. 
CESAR-P can be used for spatial scales ranging from the building to the neighbourhood and city scale. Key features of CESAR-P include: 

- Modelling of indoor temperatures, heating and cooling loads, domestic hot 
  water consumption, electricity consumption, comfort parameters, operational 
  costs and emissions, embodied emissions and investment costs of retrofitting 
  solutions, and solar irradiance on external surfaces.
- The capability to automate the extraction of building geometries from commonly used geometric file types (such as
  shapefiles), simplifying the generation of required input files.
- The archetypes used to parameterize the building models are stored as RDF triples (in TTL files). The triples contain
  ABox statements related to the construction properties defined by each archetype. The statements conform to classes
  and properties stored in the urban energy simulation ontology [@ALLAN_ET_AL_2021]. By default, a construction
  archetype will be assigned to a building instance using the building age. The construction archetype contains all of
  the material layers in the floor, roof and external walls of the building. CESAR-P loads the archetype data directly
  from the provided TTL files, but it can be configured to access a graph database instance to query archetype data. The
  reason to store the source data using RDF is due to the growing number of UBEM studies. It has been found that it is
  challenging to track assumptions used in published studies. The use of semantic web technologies such as RDF enables
  the user to query the results and underlying data used to build the simulation inputs. The use of ontologies will
  enable the linking of concepts and data models used in other studies using TBox inferences.
- Evaluation of retrofitting options and strategies.
- Simulation and comparison of energy demand for scenarios with different building parametrization, for example to
  evaluate passive cooling potential [@SILVA_ET_AL_2022].
- Since CESAR-P uses EnergyPlus, which is a continually developed energy simulation tool within the research field, the
  capabilities of CESAR-P can be extended to accommodate future developments and improve modelling accuracy.
- The tool can be applied at various scales and can be used for predicting the energy consumption of a single building,
  of whole neighbourhoods with thousands of buildings ([@WANG_ET_AL_2018] or, in combination with clustering approaches,
  for calculating national building energy demands [@MURRAY_ET_AL_2020, @EGGIMANN_ET_AL_2022].

# Example

Following we are outlining how you set up a simulation with cesar-p-core library. The snippets are based on the [basic
usage
example](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-usage-examples/blob/master/advanced_examples/basic_cesar_usage.py) in
[cesar-p-usage-examples](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-usage-examples).

The main API class of `cesar-p-core` library is the `SimulationManager`. On initialization of the class, you need to pass
the configuration and the output folder for your project. Additionally, a process wide instance of the unit registry
(handling conversion of physical units) must be provided. Here is an example minimal code snippet:

``` python
import cesarp.common
from cesarp.manager.SimulationManager import SimulationManager
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sim_manager = SimulationManager(base_output_path="results", 
                                    main_config="simple_main_config.yml",
                                    unit_reg=cesarp.common.init_unit_registry())
    sim_manager.run_all_steps()
```

In the YAML configuration, you need to define the input files of your project. Below is the minimal set of YAML
configuration statements you need for any project. The code above refers to this file as `simple_main_config.yml`.

```
MANAGER:
    SITE_VERTICES_FILE:
        PATH: "SiteVertices.csv"
    BLDG_FID_FILE:
        PATH: "BuildingInformation.csv"
        SEPARATOR: ","
        LABELS:
            gis_fid: "ORIG_FID"
    BLDG_AGE_FILE:
        PATH: "BuildingInformation.csv"
    BLDG_TYPE_PER_BLDG_FILE:
        PATH: "BuildingInformation.csv"
    SINGLE_SITE:
        WEATHER_FILE: "Zurich_2015.epw"
```

The `SiteVertices.csv` defines the footprints and height of all the buildings on your site. 

| TARGET_FID | POINT_X | POINT_Y | HEIGHT |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 1          | 0       | 0       | 12.5   |
| 1          | 0       | 0       | 12.5   |
| 1          | 25      | 0       | 12.5   |
| 1          | 25      | 0       | 12.5   |
| 1          | 0       | 0       | 12.5   |
| 2          | 35      | 0       | 12.5   |
| 2          | 35      | 0       | 12.5   |
| 2          | 60      | 0       | 12.5   |
| 2          | 60      | 0       | 12.5   |
| 2          | 35      | 0       | 12.5   |
| ...        |

The `BuildingInformation.csv` file defines the properties of the buildings. 
The configuration entry `BLDG_FID_FILE` requires the column `ORIG_FID`, entry `BLDG_TYPE_PER_BLDG_FILE` column `SIA2024BuildingType` and entry `BLDG_AGE_FILE` column `BuildingAge`. The example above includes a few more columns per building, which will be explained further down.
Usually, you will have one file defining all the properties of your buildings, but the configuration gives you 
the flexibility to point to separate files for the different building properties and also to map to custom column names to allow the use of input data files without pre-processing (see the sub-entries for `BLDG_FID_FILE`).

| ORIG_FID | SIA2024BuildingType | BuildingAge | ECarrierHeating | ECarrierDHW | GlazingRatio |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1        | MFH                 | 1900        | 2               | 2           | 13           |
| 2        | MFH                 | 1930        | 2               | 2           | 16           |
| ...      |
| 8        | MFH                 | 2012        | 2               | 2           | 30           |
| 9        | MFH                 | 2015        | 2               | 2           | 30           |

The last required input is the weather data in EnergyPlus epw format, in the example named `Zurich_2015.epw`.

## Building model parametrization

The main source of construction parameters is the archetype definitions (included in the library), which are typically assigned by
the age of a building. Operational parameters such as occupancy or loads from appliances are based on a Swiss norm
(SIA2024). Additional parameters and constants can be set in the YAML configuration. You find an overview of all the customizable
parameters in this example YAML file
[cesar-p-config-overview.yaml](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-core/blob/master/cesar-p-config-overview.yaml).
You only need to overwrite the parameters that need to be changed in your project-specific YAML configuration. The configuration statements should be declared under the correct category, using the correct indentation. The example below overwrites the following properties:

- `RANDOM_CONSTRUCTIONS` if set to `True`, CESAR-P chooses randomly one of the available construction archetypes, if
  there are several matching the age class of the processed building. 
- `GLAZING_RATIO_PER_BLDG_FILE` by default the glazing ratio is defined by a lookup based on the age of the building. 
  If you have information on the glazing ratio per building, add this information e.g. to your 
   `BuildingInformation.csv` under a column heading `GlazingRatio`.
- `RADIUS` defines the radius around a building in which other buildings are simulated as shading objects
- `MINIMAL_STORY_HEIGHT` defines the default minimum floor height to use. The number of floors is defined
  by the integer division of building height and MINIMAL_STORY_HEIGHT.

Here is an example implementation in YAML of these parameters:

```
MANAGER:
	# here go first all the default parameters from above
	....
	RANDOM_CONSTRUCTIONS: True
	GLAZING_RATIO_PER_BLDG_FILE:
		ACTIVE: True
		PATH: "BuildingInformation.csv"
GEOMETRY:
	NEIGHBOURHOOD:
		RADIUS: 50 # meter
MAIN_BLDG_SHAPE:
	MINIMAL_STORY_HEIGHT: 2.2 # meter
```

If you need additional customization, you can also define constructional and
operational parameters per building. See
[custom_constr_archetype_mapping](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-usage-examples/tree/master/advanced_examples/custom_constr_archetype_mapping) and
[operation_params_per_floor](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-usage-examples/tree/master/advanced_examples/operation_params_per_floor), respectively,
in [cesar-p-usage-examples repository](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-usage-examples).


## Results

The results consist of a set of parameters from EnergyPlus results in a table format, as absolute annual values and converted to specific per m2 values. Additionally, you can choose to calculate operational emissions. For this, you need to specify the energy installation per building. In the configuration, point to the file containing the data and activate the feature:

```
MANAGER:
	# here go first all the default parameters from above
	...
	DO_CALC_OP_EMISSIONS_AND_COSTS: True
	BLDG_INSTALLATION_FILE:		
		PATH: "../example_project_files/BuildingInformation.csv"
```

The required columns in the linked file are `ECarrierHeating`, `ECarrierDHW` defining the number key of the energy
source used for space heating and domestic hot water, respectively. The allowed options are defined in the enumeration
[EnergySource](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-core/blob/master/src/cesarp/model/EnergySource.py).

The table below is an extract of the `site_result_summary.csvy` showing the most important annual results per building:

| Bldg | Heating Annual specific | DHW Annual specific | Electricity Annual specific | Cooling Annual specific | Total PEN | Total CO2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | kWh/m2 /year | kWh/m2 /year | kWh/m2 /year | kWh/m2 /year | kWh/m2 /year | Oileq * MJ/m2 /year | CO2eq * kg/m2 /year |
| 1 | 101 | 18 | 23 | 0.9 | 898 | 49 |
| 2 | 113 | 18 | 23 | 1.1 | 963 | 54 |
| ...  |


The full list of result values reported is shown in the table below:

| Variable                             | Unit                   |

| Year used for lookup of cost factors | -                    |

It is a good practice to check the column `EnergyPlus error level` to make sure there are no errors or warnings from
EnergyPlus simulation. If there are, the details of the error are provided in the `eplus_error_summary.err` file.

In case the details about the building model geometry are desired, they are available in the
`bldgs_infos_model_generation.csv` file. For example, one can find the number of storeys and the resulting floor height of each building's geometry, as well as information on the effective glazing ratio, which can differ from your setting in case there are many small walls not having space for a window.

If hourly results are needed, adding the following line to the main script would output the domestic hot water and heating hourly values as a pandas data frame:

Additional imports needed
```
from cesarp.eplus_adapter.eplus_eso_results_handling 
    import RES_KEY_DHW_DEMAND, RES_KEY_HEATING_DEMAND
from cesarp.eplus_adapter.idf_strings import ResultsFrequency
```

After the simulation run, you can query the results from your `SimulationManager` instance:

```
hourly_demand = 
    sim_manager.collect_custom_results(
      result_keys=[RES_KEY_HEATING_DEMAND, RES_KEY_DHW_DEMAND],
      results_frequency=ResultsFrequency.HOURLY)
```

## Retrofit

For retrofitting, the general procedure is to first define a baseline simulation and then run the desired retrofit
scenarios. There are two retrofit managers implemented, the basic
[SimpleRetrofitManager](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-core/blob/master/src/cesarp/retrofit/all_bldgs/SimpleRetrofitManager.py)
and
[EnergyPerspective2050RetrofitManager](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-core/blob/master/src/cesarp/retrofit/energy_perspective_2050/EnergyPerspective2050RetrofitManager.py),
following more complex rules to decide on retrofit measures. These manager classes are used instead of the
`SimulationManager` to run your simulations. One can also implement a custom retrofit manager that defines which retrofit measures are carried out on which buildings.

A summary of the simulation results of each scenario is saved to 
`all_scenarios_result_summary.csvy`. As an example the table below shows a comparison of annual specific heating demand for three different scenarios, `orig` being the baseline, scenario `roof` where roof construction was retrofitted and `wall_win_groundf` where wall, windows and ground floor were retrofitted. Details about retrofit measures, costs and embodied emissions are available in `retrofit_log.csv` in each scenario result subfolder. Summarized figures out of those files are included in the table.

| Building | Scenario         | Heating Annual specific | Retrofit Costs | Retrofit embodied CO2 emissions |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
|          |                  | kWh/m2/year             | CHF            | CO2eq * kg                      |
| 1        | orig             | 101                     | -              | -                               |
| 1        | roof             | 94                      | 150'000        | 3'389                           |
| 1        | wall_win_groundf | 18                      | 334'077        | 21'831                          |
| 2        | orig             | 113                     | -              | -                               |
| 2        | roof             | 106                     | 150'000        | 10'067                          |
| 2        | wall_win_groundf | 18                      | 349'065        | 22'560                          |


See the [retrofit example](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-usage-examples/blob/master/advanced_examples/retrofit_simple_example.py) for more details.

## Project handling

There are several features to simplify project management, including a comparison between different simulation runs with
changed parameters, re-loading existing projects to avoid the re-creation of building models or simulating existing IDF
files. To allow for exchanging or backing up projects, there is the option to save all input files including the
constructions database in a ZIP file. Check out the [basic usage
example](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-usage-examples/blob/master/advanced_examples/basic_cesar_usage.py) to
see those features in action.
